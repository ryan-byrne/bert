# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions
> ## What is Bert?

[Bert](https://bert.thebetalab.org) (or the **Be**ta Lab **R**esource **T**ool) is a site devoted to helping Berkeley Carroll 
teachers and students leverage [tools](/docs/features/tools), [materials](/docs/features/materials) and [space](/docs/features/scheduling/reserving-the-lab) available in the Beta Lab.

> ## What is the Beta Lab?

The Berkeley Carroll Beta Lab is a 2000 square foot, two-level STEAM lab, providing the space, equipment and expertise for [Middle](https://www.berkeleycarroll.org/academics/middle-school) and [Upper](https://www.berkeleycarroll.org/academics/upper-school) School teachers and students to meaningfully explore the connections between science, technology, engineering, art and math through complex labs and student-directed projects.

Think about it like a **library**, but instead of **books**: we have **tools**!

> ## What types of projects can the lab accommodate?

Pretty much anything... *seriously*. We have built skateboards, Rube Goldberg machines, a Virtual Reality sandbox, bird houses, paper making kits, and much of the things in between.

Instead of thinking about what you *could* build, we suggest checking out the [Beta Lab - Best Practices](/docs/beta-lab-best-practices) page, which provides insight into what makes for a successful project in the lab.

> ## How can I reserve the Beta Lab?

Check out [Booking the Lab](/docs/features/scheduling/booking-the-lab)

> ## What is an Engineer in Residence?

If we continue to think of the Beta Lab as a **library for tools**, that would make the **Engineer in Residence** its **librarian**.

Along with maintaining the space and training users in its many tools, the **Engineer in Residence** can partner with teachers and students to plan out lessons, order materials, and help with the overall building of their projects.
