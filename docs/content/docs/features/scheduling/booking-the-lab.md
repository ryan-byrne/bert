Learn how to reserve space in the Beta Lab.

> **IMPORTANT:** If you plan to reserve [tools](/docs/tools), [materials](/docs/materials) or [storage](/docs/storage) you ***must*** [reserve through Bert](#bert).

## Book Through Google Calendar

There are **three** distinct **Google Calendars** for each area of the lab:

* [Classroom Area](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_2l72cqq855fvcu8l0f35donqnc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York)
* [Power Tool Area](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_cdsr663bruijjo05637v89fh4k%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York)
* [Machine Shop](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_cdm0jncrjj972nf6g6o6r2jhf4%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York)

Clicking the links above will add them to your **Google Calendar** where you can view their upcoming and past events.

To reserve the lab, you can then invite any (or all) of these calendars as an **attendee**.
