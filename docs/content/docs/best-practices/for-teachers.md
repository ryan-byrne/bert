# Best Practices - For Teachers

Over the years, we have identified some common traits that result in successful projects within the Beta Lab.

![Best Practices](/images/best-practices/bertPractice.png)

Whether for MS Science, US Humanities, or independent student work, projects best utilize the lab when they:


> ## Have Clear Learning Objectives

As mentioned in the [FAQ](/docs/faq), there is almost **no limit** to what you or the students can build in the lab. 

However, this can make planning a project quite difficult, as the options are limitless. Therefore, instead of asking:

> What do I want my students to ***build***?

Think:

> What do I want my students to ***learn***?

Once that question has been answered, potential project ideas reveal themselves more readily. 

In other words:

{{<hint info>}} The **Learning Objective** should determine the **Project**, rather than the **Project** determining the **Learning Objective.**
{{</hint>}}

### Examples

| Learning Objective                                                          | Project              |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| _"Why do different cavity nesting birds need nest boxes of varying sizes?"_ | Nest Boxes           |
| _"How can scrap paper be recycled into new sheets?"_                        | Mold and Deckle      |
| _"What causes maglev trains to be propelled forward?"_                      | Electromagnetic Loop |

> ## Connect to Classroom Learning

Students are often ***excited*** to be in the lab, but tend to be more ***engaged*** when their project ties back to what they have been learning in class.

This also solves the [previous step](#have-clear-learning-objectives) of coming up with Learning Objectives, as those are likely already in place for your unit or assignment.

> ## Require Minimal Student Design

Unless it is specified as a [Learning Objective](#have-clear-learning-objectives), students should not be expected to **design** much (if any) of their project.



> ## Meet Regularly

It is important that meeting times are scheduled closely together to ensure students:

1. Build on skills from the previous lesson
2. Maintain steady progress
3. Do not fall too far behind if they are absent

{{<hint warning>}} 
Spacing meetings too far apart can result in students misremembering or altogether forgetting the skills learned in the previous lesson.
{{</hint>}}

> ## Have a Completed Example

The purpose of this is twofold:

1. Students can better conceptualize what it is they are building
2. As the teacher, you get a better sense of what difficulties they might encounter
