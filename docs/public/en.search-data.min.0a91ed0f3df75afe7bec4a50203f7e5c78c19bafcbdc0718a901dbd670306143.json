We have built skateboards, Rube Goldberg machines, a Virtual Reality sandbox, bird houses, paper making kits, and much of the things in between.\nInstead of thinking about what you could build, we suggest checking out the Beta Lab - Best Practices page, which provides insight into what makes for a successful project in the lab.\nHow can I reserve the Beta Lab? # Check out Booking the Lab\nWhat is an Engineer in Residence? # If we continue to think of the Beta Lab as a library for tools, that would make the Engineer in Residence its librarian.\nAlong with maintaining the space and training users in its many tools, the Engineer in Residence can partner with teachers and students to plan out lessons, order materials, and help with the overall building of their projects.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/docs/best-practices/for-teachers/","title":"For Teachers","section":"Best Practices","content":" Best Practices - For Teachers # Over the years, we have identified some common traits that result in successful projects within the Beta Lab.\nWhether for MS Science, US Humanities, or independent student work, projects best utilize the lab when they:\nHave Clear Learning Objectives # As mentioned in the FAQ, there is almost no limit to what you or the students can build in the lab.\nHowever, this can make planning a project quite difficult, as the options are limitless. Therefore, instead of asking:\nWhat do I want my students to build?\nThink:\nWhat do I want my students to learn?\nOnce that question has been answered, potential project ideas reveal themselves more readily.\nIn other words:\nThe Learning Objective should determine the Project, rather than the Project determining the Learning Objective. Examples # Learning Objective Project \u0026ldquo;Why do different cavity nesting birds need nest boxes of varying sizes?\u0026rdquo; Nest Boxes \u0026ldquo;How can scrap paper be recycled into new sheets?\u0026rdquo; Mold and Deckle \u0026ldquo;What causes maglev trains to be propelled forward?\u0026rdquo; Electromagnetic Loop Connect to Classroom Learning # Students are often excited to be in the lab, but tend to be more engaged when their project ties back to what they have been learning in class.\nThis also solves the previous step of coming up with Learning Objectives, as those are likely already in place for your unit or assignment.\nRequire Minimal Student Design # Unless it is specified as a Learning Objective, students should not be expected to design much (if any) of their project.\nMeet Regularly # It is important that meeting times are scheduled closely together to ensure students:\nBuild on skills from the previous lesson Maintain steady progress Do not fall too far behind if they are absent Spacing meetings too far apart can result in students misremembering or altogether forgetting the skills learned in the previous lesson. Have a Completed Example # The purpose of this is twofold:\nStudents can better conceptualize what it is they are building As the teacher, you get a better sense of what difficulties they might encounter "}]
