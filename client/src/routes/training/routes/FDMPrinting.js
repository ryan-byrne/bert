        <h1>How Does a 3D Printer Work?</h1>
        <p>
          <b>3D Printing</b> works by placing successive layers of <b>uncured</b> plastic on top
          of one another, then curing them to make a 3-dimensional shape.
        </p>

        </Row>
        <h1>Why 3D Printing Though?</h1>
        <p>
          <b>3D Printing</b> is unique in that it is an <b>additive manufacturing</b> process,
          as opoosed to sanding, for example, which is a <b>reductive manufacturing</b> process.
          Material is <b>added</b> to the workpiece as opposed to <b>removed.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          This can be beneficial in making complex geometries and limiting waste.
        </p>
        <h1>Types of 3D Printing</h1>
        <p>Some common types of 3D printing include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li className="m-3">
            <b>Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)</b> - Far and away the most common 3D printing
            technique for its durability and ease-of-use. Works similar to a tiny hot glue gun
            sculpting a shape.
          </li>

          <li className="m-3">
            <b>Stereolithography (SLA)</b> - Another common technology that uses a Laser
            to cure a liquid resin in the desired shape. Although SLA provides a higher level
            of precision to FDM, handling the resin and curing it can sometimes be laborious.

        <h1>Working Principle</h1>
        <p>
          In this training, we will focus on <b>FDM</b> printing, which, as we learned in the previous
          section, works by feeding a plastic filamenet through a series of rollers and motors into
          a hot nozzle, which melts the plastic on a platform.
        </p>

            <Image src={FDMdiagram} fluid />

        </Row>
        <h1>Advantages</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>&#128176; Printers and required filament are extremely affordable</li>
          <li>&#9757; Easily upgradable</li>
          <li>Relatively simple compared to other 3D printing technologies</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Disadvantages</h1>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Inaccurate</b> compared to other technologies</li>
          <li>Some shapes require <b>supports</b></li>
          <li>Layers are usually visible on the surface</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Materials</h1>
        <p>Below are some common materials used in FDM printing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Polylactic Acid (PLA)</b> - a biodegradable and bioactive thermoplastic polyester
            that is the most common FDM printing material.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)</b> -
            Itâ€™s widely used in producing a multitude of everyday goods like your keyboard keycaps,
            and is a bit <b>stronger</b> than PLA.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)</b> -
            Rubber-like material used in 3D printing to produce semi-flexible parts.
          </li>

        <h1>Available Software</h1>
        <p>
          Like 3D CAD, there are many different options to do this:
        </p>
        <ul>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Slicing Settings</h1>
        <p>
          There are various settings that can be changed in your slicing software which will
          affect everything from the print time to model resolution.
        </p>
        <h2>Layer Height</h2>
        <p>
          Arguably the most important setting is <b>layer height</b>, which changes the thickness
          of each successive layer placed by the 3D printer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Decreasing</b> the layer height allows for a better quality print, but drastically
          <b> increases</b> the time required to complete it.
        </p>
        <Row>
          <Col className="text-center m-3">
            <Image src={layerHeight} fluid />
          </Col>
        </Row>
        <h2>Infill</h2>
        <p>
          Infill adjusts the amount of material inside the outer bounds of your 3D model. For
          example, an infill of <b>0%</b> would mean a <b>completely hollow</b> shape, whereas an
          <b> infill of 100%</b> would be <b>completely solid.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          As you might have guess, adding infill <b>increases the strength</b> of a part, but also
          <b> increase the time</b> it takes to complete.
        </p>
        <Row>
          <Col className="text-center m-3">
            <Image src={infill} fluid />
          </Col>
        </Row>
        <h2>Supports</h2>
        <p>
          Occasionally, the geometry of your 3D model will prevent successive layers from being
          added. In these cases, <b>supports</b> must be added and then removed later in order for
          the model to print.
        </p>
        <Row sm={1} md={2} className="m-3">
          <Col className="text-center">
            <Image src={supports} fluid />
          </Col>
          <Col className="text-center">
            <Image src={supports2} fluid />
          </Col>
        </Row>
        <h2>Additional Settings</h2>
        <p>
          Most other settings, such as nozzle temperature and travel speed are determined by your
          printer and material. Rarely will you have to change these.
        </p>
        <h1>Exporting as GCODE</h1>
        <p>
          The file then generated by the slicing software, and what will be sent to the printer
          is GCODE, which will act as instructions for the printer, controlling everything from the
          bed temperature to the printer's movements in the XYZ coordinate system.
        </p>
        <Question id="62b0d8d3e9229982648ed8af" {...{ update }}>
          Increasing the <b>(Infill/Layer Height)</b> also increases the time required to print.

        <h1>&#128293; Preheat the Nozzle and Bed</h1>
        <p>
          Each material must be printed at a specified temperature. Be sure to select the
          proper one when preheating. For example, <b>PLA</b> should have a <b>nozzle at 215Â°C </b>
          and a <b>bed at 60Â°C.</b>

          If either of these occur: cancel your print, and try leveling the build plate again.

        <h1>&#9202; Check Periodically</h1>
        <p>
          After the first layer is complete, the printer operates on its own, and can sometimes take
          over 24 hours for a single model. There is no need to sit there the whole time, but
          periodic checks help to catch issues (missed supports, filament runout), and prevent wasted
          materials or broken printers.
